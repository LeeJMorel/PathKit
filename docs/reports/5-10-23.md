## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### [Individual team members should include the following]

- **Progress**: Briefly describe what you accomplished during the past week.
- **What worked**: Highlight any successes or positive outcomes.
- **What you learned**: Share any new insights or lessons learned.
- **Issues**: Mention any challenges or roadblocks faced.
- **Plans for the following week**: Outline your tasks and goals for the upcoming week, including any unfinished tasks from the previous week and estimated time for completion.

### [Chris Bendix]

- **Progress**: Researched React component design and handling including hooks, useState, interfaces, and frontend-backend integration to sqlite. Researched local database storage behavior, package-lock, dice roller integration. Updated README file, User Manual and Developer Manuals. Identified/debugged build issues as development rapidly grew early in this iteration. Wrote documentation about the frontend-backend integration to support debugging and developer documentation. Researched the Releasing process on Github and supported the pre-release process
- **What worked**: Team communication and peer programming went really well, and studying unfamiliar code design (hooks, useState) was fruitful, I learned a lot. 
- **What you learned**: I learned a lot about useState and hooks and connecting frontend-backend modules as well as tauri packaging and documentation styling
- **Issues**: The build issues coming from the fast and furious development cycle this week required routine debugging, but stabilized as we got further into dev. My coding ability requires a lot of research and pair programming with Lee, and with those difficulties I am supporting more heavily in the research and documentation areas of the project
- **Plans for the following week**: Work with Lee on research and development for our sqlite data handling and meilisearch integration, continue to improve our User and Developer Manuals

### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Created the SQL database and connected most data instances, with issues to entity type as I intended to build the form this week but ran out of time. Created a release pipeline automation through Github Actions, releasing the buildable v0.0.1-Alpha release and finalizing the 2nd prototype. This version is very buggy in many many different ways, I decided it was better to build this out once and take my time with the entity objects. I am more focused on building the form first, and its long term integration with pathbuilder players as a downloadable option. Built a simple website to make downloading intuitive and easy for users, reusing the same color themes and components from our app.
- **What worked**: Tauri has a lot of built in tools that I could google or ask questions about on the discord, so when i got stuck I had a large support to figure out what to do. Github Actions are easy and integrated into the Tauri build with very little effort.
- **What you learned**: A LOT more about databases and SQL. I am working really hard to make this code clean and easy to follow, so I had really think through how to abstract complex SQL queries.
- **Issues**: I had to break the repro roughly twice to make everything run. Some of my original file structure was not as intuitive as I had thought and I caused issues in team communication with having multiple folders with the same name.
- **Plans for the following week**: Ideally? the search engine MVP. But more realistically we are now behind schedule, and I will have to focus on the form instead. I had to reach far outside my planned tasks to help get the product running since others were unable to contribute to the code base as we all hoped and as a result my own tasks fell a tad behind. This wouldn't be an issue on its own, but I suspect the same will happen with the search, and at this point this is all just a lot of code and there are only so many hours. I will do my very best crunch time!

## Team Report

- **Goals from last week**: Finish the MVP to a point in which one use case that touches all MVP areas can be demonstrated. Link the frontend and backend. Create a demonstration of the MVP and a reflection over previous iterations. 
- **Progress and issues**: The frontend-backend linking was a big challenge and required a substantial refactor of the sqlite handling. This led to a move from handling in Rust to the Typescript modules and a slight refactor of table instantiation in order to streamline integration with front end useStore functionality. On the design front, we need to create a logo and are behind our ideal schedule for that, which was an acceptable tradeoff to ensure focusing on a top-quality demo and reflection. We have also encountered some final-step difficulties with dice roller integration but have made great progress on its development, as a module it is ready to go and we are now simply finishing up packaging it into the app release. We have a simple website to showcase our app and provide it for download. We created our demo and reflection and reviewed it in our weekly meeting.
- **Plans and goals for the following week**: We need to develop the logo, package the dice roller if not done by end of current cycle, finish building our MVP features that handle sqlite data such as Entities, research and develop our Rust handlers that will facilitate our meilisearch integration, develop our User Manual and our Developer Manual further towards the end-product per weekly deliverables, continue to write tests, and augment our documentation as needed.  
- **Responsible team members**: Logo development: Luke, Dice roller integration: Kevin, Rust/meilisearch R&D: Jacob/Lee/Chris, sqlite handling R&D: Lee/Chris, User and Developer Manual: Chris, Test writing: Jacob
