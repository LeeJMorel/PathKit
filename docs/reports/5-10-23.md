### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Created the SQL database and connected most data instances, with issues to entity type as I intended to build the form this week but ran out of time. Created a release pipeline automation through Github Actions, releasing the buildable v0.0.1-Alpha release and finalizing the 2nd prototype. This version is very buggy in many many different ways, I decided it was better to build this out once and take my time with the entity objects. I am more focused on building the form first, and its long term integration with pathbuilder players as a downloadable option. Built a simple website to make downloading intuitive and easy for users, reusing the same color themes and components from our app. 
- **What worked**: Tauri has a lot of built in tools that I could google or ask questions about on the discord, so when i got stuck I had a large support to figure out what to do. Github Actions are easy and integrated into the Tauri build with very little effort.
- **What you learned**: A LOT more about databases and SQL. I am working really hard to make this code clean and easy to follow, so I had really think through how to abstract complex SQL queries.
- **Issues**: I had to break the repro roughly twice to make everything run. Some of my original file structure was not as intuitive as I had thought and I caused issues in team communication with having multiple folders with the same name.
- **Plans for the following week**: Ideally? the search engine MVP. But more realistically we are now behind schedule, and I will have to focus on the form instead. I had to reach far outside my planned tasks to help get the product running since others were unable to contribute to the code base as we all hoped and as a result my own tasks fell a tad behind. This wouldn't be an issue on its own, but I suspect the same will happen with the search, and at this point this is all just a lot of code and there are only so many hours. I will do my very best crunch time!
