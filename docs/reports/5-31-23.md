### [Kevin Zhang]

- **Progress**: Finished the final demo, reflecting on our plans and estimations of the project development process. Also updated README with team according to peer review feedbacks.
- **What worked**: Our project is in a great spot and our team has very specific weekly reports, making it easy for me to reflect on we have been keeping on track with our plans.
- **What you learned**: There was a number of people in the peer review mentioned that the amount of information we throw at the user is overwhelming, we over looked that fact since at this point all of us in the developing team have a decent understanding of the path finder game (Also that pathkit is mainly targeting experienced GMs), but to understand the complex system of pathfinder is still no easy task for beginnners. So it was great that we got some user pespective and we can make adjustments based on that.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Plans for the following week**: Finish the individual report.
