- **What worked**: Highlight any successes or positive outcomes.
- **What you learned**: Share any new insights or lessons learned.
- **Issues**: Mention any challenges or roadblocks faced.
- **Plans for the following week**: Outline your tasks and goals for the upcoming week, including any unfinished tasks from the previous week and estimated time for completion.

### [Chris Bendix]

- **Progress**: Got more familiar with working in React and built some front end features based on test user feedback.
- **What worked**: Communication was good with team, in particular on front end development and on code reviews.
- **What you learned**: I learned how to approach code reviews and how to integrate some front end features in React while creating a consistent and more optimal UX design. 
- **Issues**: Some complications with merges that were a good learning experience. The project has been difficult and we are deep into the quarter so morale and confidence has been a struggle. 
- **Plans for the following week**: Focus on peer reviews and documentation and work together to address bugs.

### [Kevin Zhang]

- **Progress**: The dice roller has been properly integrated, i tried many options from our frontend as well as unity, eventually i used an unity plugin that allows me to manually build the dice roller (I can reuse the build setting in the future for CI purposes just needed to do manual one time), I produced a preloaded instance of dice roller that elimiates the need of passing files back and forth between backend and frontend. The WebGL API was able to render that, And the issue was fixed from unity side. Also fixed the bug where the dice roller captures keyboard input when used. Revised turtorial module components to provide more detailed instructions to users. Made sure that our wiki meets the requirements for beta release.
- **What worked**: The unity plugins that allowed me to manually specify build options for unity, without it I don't think i will be able to fix the issue. Also the unity documentaions for building had specific examples for how to handle webgl cases, that was very helpful to get my feet wet.
- **What you learned**: Learned alot about how to deploy website based unity applications. I have only done executables so far, i never knew i could specify so many build options over so many levels with plugins, such as what decompression method can be used, scripts and objects build order, output file format/executable and even memory allocation/deallocation. Also learn how to make drop downs and visual effects with CSS and JS.
- **Issues**: The attempt to get our backend to process .gz files did not work, i even tried to make an API that processes .gz files, but that failed horribly, so the workaround mentioned by me last week was turned down, and I was glad that i was able to solve integration on unity side. There was also a bug that captures the keyboard input when dice roller is used, but at the time of this report it is fixed by introducing states to input handling. 
- **Plans for the following week**: Revise user manuals, tutorials. Help front end to debug, improve user experience and ideally finish the search bar.

### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Built all entity forms(except spells, marked as a disabled tab), paths now works with the sqlite db, created many new components to help user experience such as collapsible headers, tabs, and filtered content.
- **What worked**: The database structure is reliable and took minimal changes at this point. Formik is a useful tool for form instantiation and worked well with my existing store.
- **What you learned**: I learned a lot regarding data schemas which had to be translated for the form and for pathbuilder imports. I learned ways to store images as test which was cool.
- **Issues**: I tried to basically build something like Formik on my own at first. This was a terrible idea and failed miserably. I'm so glad these complex packages already exist with full testing supports.
- **Plans for the following week**: I will be finishing out the spells form, but also I will be working to finish out the search bar and ideally debug the error that does not allow us to load dice at the moment.

### [Luke Evans]

- **Progress**: Tweaked colors and design related to colors for the 4 themes wherever there were issues/inconsistencies with them beforehand. E.g. adding hover properties to buttons and making sure foreground text had proper contrast with background colors so all the themes are accessible, especially the high contrast themes. Designed two versions of a PathKit logo from scratch, one with a sigil-like boundary and one that focuses on the design in the middle, a wand casting magic. Both of these tasks sound much less time-consuming than they ended up being, learned a lot about digital design and working with React. Implemented the logo for tauri to generate the needed versions of it and added to the beginner box tutorial walkthrough for new GMs.
- **What worked**: Figma proved to be the most familiar tool for me to use, but I also used photopea for some operations/drawings. Youtube tutorials. Having a sketch from the start helped me focus on what to do next for the logo piece by piece. Using the inspect element tool to deduce how colors were being implemented in the UI. Writing out beginner box items in a doc for group collabing before focusing on implementing them.
- **What you learned**: If I better organized the colors and been more descriptive in how they should be used from the start, it probably would have saved a lot of time debugging when making sure that one color tweak there doesn't break a color balance elsewhere. I learned how types and variants worked to make buttons behave a certain way. Learned how original shapes can be made in digital design, how to warp text, and gained experience in iconography. Learned how to implement a logo in a tauri project. Perfectly lining things up isn't worth wasting time on as long as it looks good to the naked eye. Having perfectionistic ideas/high expectations of the logo in my head made it more difficult to work on.
- **Issues**: Could not properly bend/warp the squiggly line at the bottom of the large icon, so settled for adding a couple more shapes to fulfill the balance of the sigil. Spent much time debugging issues with my local repo and lost the ability to see a local build of the app.
- **Plans for the following week**: Add more tip menu items. My current repo doesn't produce a dev build, which was crucial when I was fixing up the colors earlier this milestone. I need to fix that. I'll also start preliminary work on the next PathKit demo. If I have extra time, I'll help front-end and can further improve the logo design.

## Team Report

- **Goals from last week**: FORMS! We wanted to ensure that everyone had done a recent release in the github history, everyone worked hard in different ways on the project and we had to be flexible as code proved to be a varied skill set even though we had a strong team that contributed a lot. Our wiki was already updated, thanks to team efforts, which made some of the goals this week more simple. We practiced code review, and everyone was able to help a bit.

- **Progress and issues**: Lee took on most of the code work for this project, there was just a lot of lack of familiarity with react and rust that really slowed the team down. Kevin got the dice roller to work, but ultimately we had to comment it out as there was an app breaking bug when it loaded for a new user. We plan to debug next week. We ran out of time to implement search.

- **Plans and goals for the following week**: Next week we will focus on the peer reviews, we will try to debug these main error points as well so that final release week can focus on repairing any bugs the users find on beta.

- **Responsible team members**: All! as usual :D
