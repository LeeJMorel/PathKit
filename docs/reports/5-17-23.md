### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Built all entity forms(except spells, marked as a disabled tab), paths now works with the sqlite db, created many new components to help user experience such as collapsible headers, tabs, and filtered content.
- **What worked**: The database structure is reliable and took minimal changes at this point. Formik is a useful tool for form instantiation and worked well with my existing store.
- **What you learned**: I learned a lot regarding data schemas which had to be translated for the form and for pathbuilder imports. I learned ways to store images as test which was cool.
- **Issues**: I tried to basically build something like Formik on my own at first. This was a terrible idea and failed miserably. I'm so glad these complex packages already exist with full testing supports.
- **Plans for the following week**: I will be finishing out the spells form, but also I will be working to finish out the search bar and ideally debug the error that does not allow us to load dice at the moment.

## Team Report

- **Goals from last week**: FORMS! We wanted to ensure that everyone had done a recent release in the github history, everyone worked hard in different ways on the project and we had to be flexible as code proved to be a varied skill set even though we had a strong team that contributed a lot. Our wiki was already updated, thanks to team efforts, which made some of the goals this week more simple. We practiced code review, and everyone was able to help a bit.

- **Progress and issues**: Lee took on most of the code work for this project, there was just a lot of lack of familiarity with react and rust that really slowed the team down. Kevin got the dice roller to work, but ultimately we had to comment it out as there was an app breaking bug when it loaded for a new user. We plan to debug next week. We ran out of time to implement search.

- **Plans and goals for the following week**: Next week we will focus on the peer reviews, we will try to debug these main error points as well so that final release week can focus on repairing any bugs the users find on beta.

- **Responsible team members**: All! as usual :D
