## Contributions of Individual Team Members

### [Individual team members should include the following]

- **Progress**: Briefly describe what you accomplished during the past week.
- **What worked**: Highlight any successes or positive outcomes.
- **What you learned**: Share any new insights or lessons learned.
- **Issues**: Mention any challenges or roadblocks faced.
- **Plans for the following week**: Outline your tasks and goals for the upcoming week, including any unfinished tasks from the previous week and estimated time for completion.

### [Chris Bendix]

- **Progress**: 
- **What worked**:
- **What you learned**:
- **Issues**:
- **Plans for the following week**:

### [Jacob Anderson]

- **Progress**: researched CI, and got vitest onto the repo, with the first passing test (placeholder)
- **What worked**: lots of helpful documentation on the web with all these testing tools. Despite the complexity, it seems to have lots of intuitive features.
- **What you learned**: lots of CI research into GH actions, how testing is done with react apps
- **Issues**: I had trouble motivating myself to write documetation this week, so today will be a scramble to finish my deliverables, but that's on me. I have a better plan this week to keep myself on track.
- **Plans for the following week**: this week will have lots of documentation writing and test planning. Also need to meet with various sub-groups of the team to make sure testing covers everything it needs to

### [Kevin Zhang]

- **Progress**: Fixed the edge landing bug of dice roller, further polished UIs of dice roller, experimented with unitywebGL for dice roller front end integration. Updated docmentation on living doc with coding guidelines, risk assessment, architecture and design.
- **What worked**:The webgl APIs did integrate my dice roller into front end, my proposed fixes for dice roller bug and the UI designs for it were intuitive and working.
- **What you learned**: unity webGL has to divide the unity project into compoents such as object, animation and simulation before it can operate smoothly on react end.
- **Issues**: The unity webGL does not allow me to render unity stuff outside the screen space that is dedicated to me (so dice roller cant use our front end as background), so if we want to use the dice roller over the front end UI I will need to make the dice roller standalone, but we have decided to put it in a corner for scope reasons.
- **Plans for the following week**: integrate dice roller into frontend, help setting up SQLdata base, collect feedback from HCI about dice roller(if integration works) and make sure dice roller is working in general.

### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Documentation updates to Wiki and Living Doc for clear instruction, risk assessments, and continued front end dev work for our prototype, which now has color themes, accesibility features, and funtional menus. Instantiated a temporary online deployment of pathkit and built a HCI prototyping survey for user feedback since our target demographic will be outside the class audience.
- **What worked**: hooks, dear lord, so many hooks. Local storage is fully built now, so much of our database already exists in the front end space. it alos prevented the clogged up props which I had originally built from being all over the app, instead we use the store for data at a high level. Also messasing other devs on github! we have a few things built in that I needed advice on, so i messaged the open scource devs of those directly for feedback.
- **What you learned**: I spent a lot of time learning about directory structures and how to properly sort my code base. This is massive, much larger than my previous projects, and so organization was complex and important to the app's ability to get future collaboration.
- **Issues**: development speed is so fast I could clean up the code quite a bit. I also did not prioritize stuff like commenting my code which would really help in the future due to dev speed. I hope this can be cleaned up for final release.
- **Plans for the following week**: get HCI feedback on the prototype, Create entity objects and forms that actually work, rather then the current false form object that exists. clean up code as I go and begin adding commentary while the SQL database is spun up.

### [Luke Evans]

- **Progress**: Implemented color schemes for parchment, dark, and contrast themes.
- **What worked**: Met with Lee where they showed me how to edit colors for individual components, my work was more quick and effective after that.
- **What you learned**: How styles are used, scss files, debugging where a certain color is employed and how to tweak it.
- **Issues**: Contrast color scheme is not the most visually appealing, so may need to tweak that.
- **Plans for the following week**: Design all the components in Figma, meet with Lee to see if that is being done properly, research contrast color schemes, get HCI feedback on the prototype. 

## Team Report

- **Goals from last week**: 
  1. Turn in the living doc (Luke)
  2. Develop ER diagram (Chris, Lee)
  3. Document packages in living doc (Chris, Jacob)
  4. Writing three new sections in living doc: Software Architecture, Coding Guidelines, Software Design
  5. Risk assessment (all)
- **Progress and issues**: 
  1. Rendered a gui to the web for modeling, demoed in team meeting by Lee
  2. Deliverables for GPS cycle and further documenation were achiveved
  3. Testing framework is up and functional with a single placeholder test
  4. We want to accelerate the UX component definitions and color theme implementation which is a bit behind schedule
- **Plans and goals for the following week**:
  1. Design all Figma components (Luke)
  2. Install dice roller instance (Kevin)
  3. Install test libraries (Jacob)
  4. Write testing and CI documentation (Jacob)
  5. Define UX components (color themes in by EOD Tuesday) (Luke)
  6. Research contrast color schemes (Luke)
  7. Get HCI feedback on the prototype (Luke/Lee)
  8. Create entity objects and forms with functionality (Lee)
  9. Clean up code and begin adding commentary (Lee)
  10. Install SQLite to project base (Chris)
  11. Create basic tables in SQLite as defined by our diagram (Chris)
  12. Jacob meets with each unit to discuss testing integration in each area (Team)
- **Responsible team members**: 
  As noted - with Jacob handling a bulk of this cycle, other teams need to support on how their areas connect, and be available for questions Jacob might have
