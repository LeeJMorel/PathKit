### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Documentation updates to Wiki and Living Doc for clear instruction, risk assesments, and continued front end dev work for our prototype, which now has color themes, accesibility features, and funtional menus. Instantiated a temporary online deployment of pathkit and built a HCI prototyping survey for user feedback since our target demographic will be outside the class audience.
- **What worked**: hooks, dear lord, so many hooks. Local storage is fully built now, so much of our database already exists in the front end space. it alos prevented the clogged up props which I had originally built from being all over the app, instead we use the store for data at a high level. Also messasing other devs on github! we have a few things built in that I needed advice on, so i messaged the open scource devs of those directly for feedback.
- **What you learned**: I spent a lot of time learning about directory structures and how to properly sort my code base. This is massive, much larger than my previous projects, and so organization was complex and important to the app's ability to get future collaboration.
- **Issues**: development spped is so fast I could clean up the code quite a bit. I also did not prioritize stuff like commenting my code which would really help in the future due to dev speed. I hop this can be cleaned up for final release.
- **Plans for the following week**: get HCI feedback on the prototype, Create entity objects and forms that actually work, rather then the current false form object that exists. clean up code as I go and begin adding commentary while the SQL database is spun up.
