### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Created the starting framework for the UI, and nested it inside an executable (Tauri), documentation was updated at multiple points.
- **What worked**: We have a downloadable app! I have not yet released a build (will do that at Alpha)
- **What you learned**: I learned all about tauri, we had to reframe froma  docker package to the executable option.
- **Issues**: Not much, had a couple of codsing issues here and there, to be expected as a junior dev.
- **Plans for the following week**: Next week has some more needed documentation to focus on, including possible coordination with back-end team. Going to build out the ER Diagram with backend to ensure high-level schema exsists, and rubber duck possible UI issues in the process. Hopefully all components are built, so we can start HCI testing to prevent future user error.
