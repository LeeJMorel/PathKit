- **What worked**: Team development of communication avenues has been a major highlight as well as collaboration on user experience focus through the role-play meeting.

- **Issues**: My lack of familiarity with project design and needs, and issue identification and management, is something I need to continue to work to overcome

### [Kevin Zhang]

- **Progress**: Carried out a game of pathfinder with team to familiarize with user needs, learned about scrum workflow, contributed to living document, identified use cases and actionable issues for upcoming project cycles. Got a prototype of the dice roller, made 3D models of the dices, implemented the basics of the rolling mechanic (both normal version and rigged version).
- **What worked**: The prototype of dice roller, and the game of pathfinder was great for team bonding and looking at user needs.
- **What you learned**: I learned more about how unity handle 3D objects with proportional corners, and a lot more about my teammates! 
- **Issues**: The backend team was unclear about what the functionality are to be expected, coming up deliverables had been diffcult, but I believe as we expose more to the project this issue will be solved.
- **Plans for the following week**: Start on the documentation for backend components and adding UI logics to the dice roller. As we already have our github page setup.

### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Got up the github, built out the living document format as well as scoped many possible challenges and use cases, added React front end, began SCRUM schedualing, played GAMES!
- **What worked**: The game was a great team collaboration point, and the github and scheduale is looking great so far for my deliverables
- **What you learned**: I learned a lot more about my teammates, and some new ideas about how to properly scope a project 
- **Issues**: Since our team is very new and many are unfamiliar with Pathfinder 2e which the project is based on defining deliverables has been challenging and for some teams impossible. I've had to put in significant extra work to try to help everyone get involved but hopefully thats mostly focused more at the start of the project as people get familiar with what we are doing.
- **Plans for the following week**: I plan to start on some of the React documentation for the upcoming DnA stage as I have finished the GPS deliverables for myself. I also plan on meeting my Front-end deliverables for rapid prototyping and get a basic frame up and running for the front end.
