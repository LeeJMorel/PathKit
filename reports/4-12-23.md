### [Lee Janzen]

- **Progress**: Got up the github, built out the living document format as well as scoped many possible challenges and use cases, added React front end, began SCRUM schedualing, played GAMES!
- **What worked**: The game was a great team collaboration point, and the github and scheduale is looking great so far for my deliverables
- **What you learned**: I learned a lot more about my teammates, and some new ideas about how to properly scope a project
- **Issues**: Since our team is very new and many are unfamiliar with Pathfinder 2e which the project is based on defining deliverables has been challenging and for some teams impossible. I've had to put in significant extra work to try to help everyone get involved but hopefully thats mostly focused more at the start of the project as people get familiar with what we are doing.
- **Plans for the following week**: I plan to start on some of the React documentation for the upcoming DnA stage as I have finished the GPS deliverables for myself. I also plan on meeting my Front-end deliverables for rapid prototyping and get a basic frame up and running for the front end.
